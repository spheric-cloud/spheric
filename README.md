Spheric is an open source system for scalable management of compute resources.

The Spheric API is built using the Kubernetes API model as an aggregated API server.
Spheric resources don't have tight couplings to the Kubernetes core resources.

> [!NOTE]
> Spheric is a hard fork of [ironcore](https://github.com/ironcore-dev/ironcore) /
> [onmetal-api](https://github.com/onmetal/onmetal-api).
